Based on this sentence: "For every ride that finishes on time (or early), you will earn points proportional to the distance of that ride;
plus an additional bonus if the ride also started precisely on time."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Explanation:
------------
We have a greedy approach, that we solve the problem for each car independently and apply this for every cars.

First: 
we sort our rides according to:
1- Its earliest start, so we can get as maximum bonus as possible.
2- Points I will get from taking this ride, which is equal to the distance between its start and its end.

Second:
We loop on all the non taken rides, and calculating the time it takes me to reach its starting place
adding this time to my current time and checking if i can take the ride and finish it before its latest finish.
So, I can get points from it.
If this condition falis, I won't take that ride and continue looping on other rides with my current time as it is.

Third:
Sort the rides again after removing the taken ride according to its latest finish and its points.
So, I can then take rides that will finish early.

We apply this process for all cars starting with time = 0 and removing any ride that has been taken before.
